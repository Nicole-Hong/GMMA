## Project Overview

This team project is intended for practicing some of the techniques from class on real
world data and to explain those results to a managerial audience. It is composed of two deliverables: a
proposal and the final report.

To start this project, a team will be asked to obtain a dataset and propose a collection of analysis and
data management techniques to apply to that data. An ideal dataset will have sufficient observations and
variables to support a wide range of analysis. 

### Proposal:
A short document that presents the techniques a team proposes to use and the data to be used 
For each technique, the following should be addressed:
- Specifically what was proposed to do
- Why each technique is appropriate for the data
- What problems you might have/limitations you may encounter, and what you plan to do about
them

### Final report:
The report containing an executive summary designed for an executive-level audience along with a technical summary of the analysis.
In this report, a team will present both a technical and managerial description of each of the five
techniques completed along with their individual findings as appropriate such as follows:
- A business memo in Word covering both business and technical descriptions
- A PowerPoint presentation focused on recommendations and the business problem with a
technical appendix
- A Tableau Dashboard/Story with enough context for the business problem, and a technical
appendix
Ultimately,   the   report   should   address   one   or   more   specific   business   problem(s)   with
recommendations or insights, provide insight into the underlying data, contain output from the
analyses, and include any artifacts that are important in convincing management to take
the recommendation proposed.

## Data Used

F1 race data from 1950 to 2021: Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2021)

### Context
Formula 1 (a.k.a. F1 or Formula One) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word "formula" in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads.

### Content
The dataset consists of all information on the Formula 1 races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, championships from 1950 till the latest 2020 season.

### Data Analysis
R was used as the programming language to analyze the F1 data and to develop the predictive model.

# Customer Analytics at BigBasket, the India's largest online supermarket

Based on the BigBasket Case for the Product Recommendation, the retailer's data was analyzed and analytics models were developed to optimize their business processes.

## Assigned Work
I was the team lead for this team executive challenge, and was responsible for conducting the market basket analysis and developing the association rules using the Apriori function to come up with the recommender system (https://towardsdatascience.com/apriori-association-rule-mining-explanation-and-python-implementation-290b42afdfc6).

Visuals provided in this repository are to showcase my work that features the process of developing the association rules, using R.
